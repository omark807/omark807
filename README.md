### Hello! 

🥳 Welcome to my GitHub!

🍵 I use he/him/his pronouns. 

🎓 I graduated with a B.S in [Computer Science + Crop Sciences](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/degree-program-options/cs-x-degree-programs/computer-science-crop-sciences) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) in 2021, and am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science.

💼 **I am actively seeking research internships (especially UX research) for summer 2024.** I am open to software engineering, product and/or program management, and consulting internships as well. 

✨ My research interests primarily revolve around **accessibility** and making technology (particularly online social spaces) accessible to all, especially those with visual impairments, as well as  **usable security and privacy**, wanting to understand the ways that security and privacy-related information is conveyed online, and how those with disabilities may be at an increased risk at absorbing misinformation. 

🌍 I also love learning about all of the different ways data is used to make the world a more inclusive place for everyone, and frequently seek out ways that inaccessible data affects society.

🍳 My non-professional interests include fitness, reading, cooking, gaming, and writing!
