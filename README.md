### Hello! 

🥳 Welcome to my GitHub!

🍵 I use he/him/his pronouns. 

🎓 I graduated with a B.S in [Computer Science + Crop Sciences](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/degree-program-options/cs-x-degree-programs/computer-science-crop-sciences) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) in 2021, and am currently pursuing graduate studies in Computer Science.

💼 **I am actively seeking research internships for summer 2023.** I am open to software engineering, research engineering, product + program management, and consulting internships as well, but am mainly interested in research and consulting-based opportunities. 

✨ My research interests primarily revolve around **accessibility** and making technology (and in particular user interfaces) accessible to all, especially those with visual impairments, as well as  **usable security and privacy**, wanting to understand the ways that the digital world is less secure for those with disabilities and how we can address these issues.

🌍 I also love learning about all of the different ways data is used to make the world a more inclusive place for everyone, and love learning more about data visualizations and the ways that inaccessible data affects society.

🍳 My non-professional interests include fitness, reading, cooking, and writing!
