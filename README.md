### Hello! 

🥳 Welcome to my GitHub!

🎓 I graduated with a B.S in [Computer Science + Crop Sciences](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/degree-program-options/cs-x-degree-programs/computer-science-crop-sciences) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) in 2021, and am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science.

💼 **I am actively seeking research internships for summer 2025.** I am also open to software engineering, product and/or program management, and consulting internships. 

✨ My research interests primarily revolve around **accessibility** and making technology accessible to all, especially those within the blind and low-vision (BLV) community, as well as  **education**, wanting to understand the ways that education (particularly CS education) is inaccessible to those with disabilities. I am also interested in understanding **mental health** within the BLV community; more specifically, through lived experiences as well as volunteer opportunities, I have developed a nuanced understanding of the emotions associated with vision loss, and I am motivated to discern whether existing technologies adequately support the BLV community (especially those with low-vision). 

🌍 I also love learning about all of the different ways data is used to make the world a more inclusive place for everyone and frequently seek out ways that inaccessible data affects society.

🍳 My non-professional interests include fitness, reading, cooking, gaming, and writing!
