### Hello hello! 

<!--
**omark807/omark807** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

🥳 Welcome to my GitHub, where the party always kinda sorta keeps on going!

🍵 I use he/him/his pronouns. 

🌽 I'm a fourth-year student studying Computer Science + Crop Sciences with a minor in linguistics.

✨ My current projects revolve around accessibility and human-computer interaction. This includes UIUC's [ClassTranscribe] (https://classtranscribe-dev.ncsa.illinois.edu) and working at the ORCHID Lab.

🌍 I love learning about all of the different ways data is used to make the world a more inclusive place for everyone, so some of my current coursework consists of studying social visualizations. In general, researching and creating technology that makes the lives of those that use it easier is extremely important to me.

🧥 Fun fact: I love sweaters of many kinds and am always looking to expand my collection. :)
